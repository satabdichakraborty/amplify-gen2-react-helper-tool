1001,2024-06-01,What is the primary benefit of using a distributed version control system like Git?,MCQ,Active,Better collaboration with multiple developers,Faster performance for large projects,Ability to work offline,Simplified command structure,,,,,"Git allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase without constant internet connectivity or server availability.","While Git can be performant, this is not its primary advantage over centralized systems.","Working offline is an important benefit, but not considered the primary advantage.","Git's command structure is often considered more complex than some centralized alternatives.",,,,,,A,"Git's distributed nature enables better collaboration workflows, especially in large or distributed teams.",Version Control,Software Development,git;dvcs;collaboration
1002,06/02/2024,Which of the following is NOT a valid React Hook?,MCQ,Active,useContext(),useCallback(),useHistory(),useState(),,,,,"useContext is a built-in React Hook used for consuming context.","useCallback is a built-in React Hook for memoizing callback functions.","useHistory is part of react-router, not a core React Hook.","useState is one of the most commonly used React Hooks.",,,,,,C,"While useHistory is commonly used in React applications, it's not a built-in React Hook but rather comes from the react-router library.",React,Frontend Development,react;hooks;javascript
1003,June 3 2024,What does the AWS Lambda service provide?,MCQ,Active,Serverless compute service,Container orchestration,Load balancing,Content delivery network,,,,,"AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.","AWS ECS and EKS provide container orchestration, not Lambda.","Elastic Load Balancing is a separate AWS service for distributing incoming traffic.","Amazon CloudFront is AWS's content delivery network service.",,,,,,A,"AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, scaling automatically and only charging for the compute time consumed.",Cloud Computing,AWS,serverless;lambda;aws
1004,2024/06/04,Which sorting algorithm has the best average-case time complexity?,MCQ,Active,Bubble Sort,Quick Sort,Insertion Sort,Selection Sort,,,,,"Bubble Sort has O(n²) average-case time complexity.","Quick Sort has O(n log n) average-case time complexity.","Insertion Sort has O(n²) average-case time complexity.","Selection Sort has O(n²) average-case time complexity.",,,,,,B,"Quick Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n), which is better than the O(n²) complexity of bubble, insertion, and selection sorts.",Algorithms,Computer Science,sorting;algorithms;complexity
1005,Thursday June 5th,Which of these authentication methods is MOST secure for API access?,MCQ,Active,Basic Authentication,API Keys,OAuth 2.0 with JWT,IP Whitelisting,,,,,"Basic Authentication sends credentials with each request and lacks token expiration.","API Keys are more secure than Basic Auth but can be compromised if exposed.","OAuth 2.0 with JWT provides token expiration, scope control, and doesn't expose credentials.","IP Whitelisting restricts access by location but doesn't authenticate the user.",,,,,,C,"OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens offers superior security through limited token lifetimes, scope restrictions, and the ability to revoke access without changing credentials.",Security,API Development,security;authentication;oauth
1006,1717718400,Which of the following options can help identify performance bottlenecks in a web application?,MRQ,Active,Network profiling,CPU profiling,Memory profiling,Database query analysis,Code coverage analysis,Error monitoring,User session recording,A/B testing,"Network profiling helps identify slow network requests and payload sizes.","CPU profiling helps identify JavaScript execution bottlenecks.","Memory profiling helps identify memory leaks and excessive memory usage.","Database query analysis helps identify slow or inefficient queries.","Code coverage analysis measures test coverage, not performance.","Error monitoring tracks exceptions but doesn't directly measure performance.","Session recording can help identify UX issues but isn't primarily for performance analysis.","A/B testing compares feature variants but doesn't specifically measure performance.",ABCDG,"Performance bottlenecks can occur at various levels of a web application, including network, CPU, memory, database, and user interactions. Proper profiling across these dimensions helps identify and address performance issues.",Web Development,Performance Optimization,performance;profiling;optimization
